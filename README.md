# pos64splitter

An automated staker for PoS assetchains. Please see https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-staked for details on pos64 POS implementation. 

This is a work in progress. We aim to make this easy to use and as "set and forget" as possible. Please feel free to contribute code and ideas. 

Currently, this will maintain a static number of UTXOs. This is important because a staking wallet can become very bloated over time. The block reward of any staked blocks will be combined with the UTXO used to stake the block.

```

Binaries will be created at `pos64staker/dist/TUIstaker.exe` and `pos64staker/dist/staker.exe`

### Using Windows Binaries

Once you have built or downloaded both `TUIstaker.exe` and `staker.exe`, place both files in the same folder with `komodod.exe`. 

Start the chain and fund your node with the coins you intend to stake. You can do this via a GUI wallet or via `komodod.exe` in terminal. Please see [this document](https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/interacting-with-smart-chains.html#using-komodo-cli) if you're unfamilar with this. 

Open a CMD terminal or git bash terminal(recommended). 

Navigate to the folder with `TUIstaker.exe`, `staker.exe` and `komodod.exe`. In this example, we will use a folder named `pos64staker` the Downloads folder.

Using CMD
```shell
cd
cd Downloads\pos64staker
TUIstaker.exe
```

Using git bash
```shell
cd
cd Downloads/pos64staker
./TUIstaker.exe
```

Select `2 | <Add/remove chain>`, type in the ticker of the chain then select the chain from the initial menu. 

Select `1 | Generate address json` and wait for this to finish. You can now close the TUI via `ctrl + c` or typing `q` then hitting enter.

Open the newly created json file in a text editor. It will be named <CHAIN>.json. For example, if you did this for LABS, the json will be named `LABS.json`, located at `Downloads\pos64staker\LABS.json`. Copy one of the pubkeys listed(starts with 02 or 03).

 Restart the daemon with `"-blocknotify=staker.py %s <CHAIN>" -pubkey=<PUBKEY>` appended to the chain paremeters. For example, the parameters for LABS would look like this:
```shell
komodod.exe -ac_name=LABS -ac_supply=350689 -ac_reward=0,0,800000000 -ac_decay=0,100000000,100000000 -ac_halving=129,1 -ac_end=128,10080,0 -ac_staked=51 -ac_notarypay=64,100000000,1000000000 -ac_eras=3 -ac_cc=101 -ac_ccenable=226,236 -ac_cclib=labs -ac_sapling=1 -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=80.240.17.222 "-blocknotify=staker.exe %s LABS" -pubkey=020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
Please note, that this pubkey, `020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` is invalid and is used only as an example. This value will be unique to your node. 

Wait for the daemon to start and run `TUIstaker.exe` from the terminal once again. 

Select, `2 | Distribute balance evenly across segids`. Once this is finished, your node is now ready to stake. 

Activate staking through a GUI or by running `komodo-cli.exe -ac_name=<CHAIN> setgenerate true 0` via a terminal. 

Please note that not all features are supported in Windows at this time, namely `Start a new chain`, `restart daemon with -blocknotify`, `start a chain from assetchains.json` and `Bootstrap a chain from dexstats.info` are not currently supported. 

## How to Use OSX/Linux Scripts

```shell
git clone https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker
cd pos64staker
./TUIstaker.py
```

# Initial Menu

```shell
pos64staker by KMDLabs
===============

0 | Start a chain from assetchains.json
1 | Bootstrap a chain from dexstats.info
2 | <Add/remove chain>
q | Exit TUI
===============
```

## 0 | Start a chain from assetchains.json

This can be used if the chain is not already running and it is included in jl777's [assetchains.json](https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/beta/src/assetchains.json) file. This will first check to see if the file `~pos64staker/assetchains.json` exists. If it does not, it will download the latest from jl777's komodo repo beta branch. If a new chain is added to this file, you will need to delete `~pos64staker/assetchains.json` to force pos64staker to fetch the latest version. It is also possible to add chains to this file manually if they are not included in jl777's verison. 

## 1 | Bootstrap a chain from dexstats.info

This will attempt to bootstrap the chain from dexstats.info. This will download the neccesary blockchain data and automatically extract it to the chain's data directory, negating the need to sync the chain manually. Please note that not all Smart Chain bootstraps are available on dexstats.info. *Note:*bootstrapping is not recommended but is provided as an option for those who undertand the risk. 

## 2 | <Add/remove chain>

If the chain is already running, this can be used to add it to `staker.conf` file. This file is just a simple list of chains you have previously added.

After selecting one of these options, the menu will be updated to include the chain you selected. 

```shell
pos64staker by KMDLabs
===============
0 | LABS

1 | Start a chain from assetchains.json
2 | Bootstrap a chain from dexstats.info
3 | <Add/remove chain>
q | Exit TUI
===============
```

Now select the chain by inputting `0`(or the associated value if you have added multiple chains) and hitting enter. This will bring you to the main menu of pos64staker:

# Staking Menu

```shell
LABS
===============
0 | <return to previous menu>

1 | Generate address json
2 | Distribute balance evenly across segids
3 | Import an already existing address json
4 | Withdraw coins
5 | Start a new chain
6 | Restart daemon with -blocknotify
7 | Unlock all locked utxos
8 | Stats menu
9 | Dilithium menu

q | Exit TUI
===============
```

If you are setting this up for the first time, simply fund the node with the coins you would like to stake, select `1 | Generate address json`, select `2 | Distribute balance evenly across segids`, `6 | Restart daemon with -blocknotify` then run `komodo-cli -ac_name=<CHAIN> setgenerate true 0`.

## 1 | Generate address json

This is very first thing you should select if you are setting this up on a chain for the first time. This will generate a json file with 64 addresses, one for each segid. The file will be saved at `~/pos64staker/<CHAIN>.json`. It is **vitally important** to keep this file safe as it has private keys for each address in it. 

## 2 | Distribute balance evenly across segids

This will distribute the node's full balance evenly across all 64 segids. This is neccesary to ensure optimal staking rewards. After selecting this option, you will be prompted with `Please specify the amount of UTXOs to send to each segid:`. This is simply asking how many UTXOs to send to *each* segid. For example, if you input `10`, 640 (10*64 segids) UTXOs will be created total. After inputting the amount of UTXOs, you will be prompted with `Enter percentage of variance:`. This will be the variance in UTXO size. For example, if you inputted `10` for the first prompt and `5` for the second prompt, this will create 640 UTXOs with a size variance of `5%`. There is quite a bit of strategy involved with pos64 staking, and these values can be tweaked for optimal performance. If you aren't interested in optimizing this to the fullest extent, simply use `10` UTXOs and `5%` variance. 

## 3 | Import an already existing address json

This can be used instead of `Generate address json` if you have an already existing json. This is useful if you are migrating to a new setup or would like to use the same 64 addresses across multiple Smart Chains. 

## 4 | Withdraw coins

This should be used if you need to move coins from your staking setup. This will spend the newest UTXOs(least likely to stake soon). Without this, you are likely to negatively impact your staking performance while sending coins away from your staking node. 

## 5 | Start a new chain

This feature will automate the setup of a ac_staked Smart Chain. This is useful to prevent chains stalls. Without a proper staking node setup, newly created `ac_staked` chains are prone to chain stalls. To use this, you should finalize your chain parameters, start two nodes with the parameters, ensure they are connected to each other. Prior to mining block 1 on either, select this option. This will lead you through a series of prompts and ensure a proper staking setup to prevent chain stalls. 

## 6 | Restart daemon with -blocknotify

This will restart the daemon to append `-blocknotify` and `-pubkey` to the start parameters. This is neccesary for the UTXO management features of pos64staker. This will make the daemon run the `staker.py` script each time a new block arrives. This script will automatically manage any staking rewards and ensure a close to optimal staking setup. 

## 7 | Unlock all locked utxos

This should be used if the  `2 | Distribute balance evenly across segids` feature fails due to a bug or the program being halted at an inoppurtune time. 

## 8 | Stats menu

## `9 | Dilithium menu`


### How the staker.py works

on block arrival:

getinfo for -pubkey 

setpubkey for R address 

check coinbase -> R address 

if yes check segid of block.

if -1 send PoW mined coinbase to :

        listunspent call ... 

        sort by amount -> smallest at top and then by confirms -> lowest to top. (we want large and old utxos to maximise staking rewards.)

        select the top txid/vout

        add this txid to txid_list

        get last segid stakes 1440 blocks (last24H)

        select all segids under average stakes per segid in 24H

        randomly choose one to get segid we will send to.        

if segid >= 0 :

    fetch last transaction in block

    check if this tx belongs to the node

    if yes, use alrights code to combine this coinbase utxo with the utxo that staked it.
    
    
### Withdraw 

Withdraw script is for withdrawing funds from a staking node, without messing up utxo distribution. Works like this:

    Asks for percentage you want locked (kept). 
    
    It then counts how many utxo per segid. 
    
    Locks the largest and oldest utxos in each segid up to the % you asked.
    
    Gives balance of utxos remaning that are not locked.  These should be the smallest and newest utxo's in each segid. The least likely to stake.
    
    Then lets you send some coins to an address. 
    
    Unlocks utxos again.
